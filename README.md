Opencaster-ATSC
===============

OpenCaster is a collection of open source and free software for the Debian GNU/Linux system to play out and multiplex MPEG transport streams. OpenCaster generates most of the non audio/video data present into transport streams and handle playout of pre-encoded audio/video files or can be integrated with third parties audio/video encoders. (From Wikipedia)

OpenCaster is a grand piece of software; but being developed in Europe, it lacks documentation and examples of implementing several ATSC tables. The aim of this little "project", is to allow people in the US, Canada, and South Korea to use OpenCaster for Amateur/HamTelevision, "community" television, and other areas where a open-source TS generator would be useful.

What's done so far:
- TVCT (Virtual Channels)
- Event Information Tables
- Extended Information Tables

What needs to be done:
- Rating Region Tables
- System Time Tables.
- DCCSCT
